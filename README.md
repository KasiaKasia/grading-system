# Grading System  

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.14.

# About

The application has been designed with `WCAG` (`Web Content Accessibility Guidelines`) accessibility standards in mind, to ensure digital accessibility. I used the `@ngrx/signal` library to implement the WCAG principles.  
The application has the functionality of viewing configured grades and a configuration mechanism by adding, editing and removing school grade thresholds. During implementation, I also took optimisation into account. Among other things, by limiting the loading of libraries. To improve performance, I disabled `Zone.js` and switched to the `provideZonelessChangeDetection()` method.  For the implementation of the layout, I used Angular Material. You can run the project using SSR `Server-Side Rendering`.
 


## Steps to run the application using SSR

1. Clone the repository:

- [ ] git clone https://github.com/KasiaKasia/grading-system.git

2. In the project directory, run the following commands:

- [ ] `npm i`
- [ ] `npm run build`
- [ ] `npm run serve:ssr:grading-system-ssr-material`

3. Next, open a web browser and navigate to the following address: http://localhost:4000/


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
